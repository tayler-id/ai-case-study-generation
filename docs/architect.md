1. High-Level Architecture
Technical Summary
This project will be a full-stack, cloud-native application built within a monorepo. The architecture features a Jamstack frontend built with Next.js and hosted on Vercel for optimal performance and user experience. The backend is a decoupled, containerized Python FastAPI service hosted on Google Cloud Run, providing a scalable, serverless API. Data persistence is handled by a managed Google Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) database that includes the pgvector extension for semantic search capabilities. This architecture is designed for scalability, maintainability, and a seamless developer experience.

Platform and Infrastructure Choice
Platform: Vercel + Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Key Services: Vercel Hosting, Google Cloud Run, Google Cloud SQL, Google Secret Manager, Google OAuth.

Deployment Host and Regions: Vercel (Global Edge Network), GCP us-central1 (or nearest region).

Repository Structure
Structure: Monorepo

Tooling: We will use pnpm workspaces to manage dependencies between the frontend (/apps/web) and backend (/apps/api) packages. A /packages/shared directory will be used for shared TypeScript types and utilities.

Architectural Patterns
Jamstack Architecture: For the frontend. This pattern (pre-rendering static assets and using APIs for dynamic functionality) provides superior performance, security, and scalability.

Serverless Container Architecture: For the backend. Using Google Cloud Run allows us to run our containerized FastAPI application in a serverless environment, meaning it scales to zero (saving costs) and scales automatically with traffic.

Repository Pattern: For the backend's data access layer. This pattern abstracts the data logic, making our application easier to test, maintain, and potentially migrate to a different database in the future.

Perfect. The tech stack is locked in.

Now, we will define the Data Models that will form the backbone of our application's logic. This is where we define the structure of our data. I'll propose each model one by one, including a TypeScript interface that can be shared between the frontend and backend in our monorepo.

We'll start with the foundational User model.

3. Data Models
User
Purpose: Represents an authenticated user of the application.

Key Attributes:

id: Unique identifier (e.g., UUID).

googleId: The user's unique ID from Google.

email: The user's email address.

name: The user's full name.

avatarUrl: URL to their profile picture.

createdAt: Timestamp of when the user first signed up.

updatedAt: Timestamp of the last update to the user record.

TypeScript Interface (packages/shared/src/types/user.ts)

TypeScript

export interface User {
  id: string;
  googleId: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  avatarUrl: string;
  createdAt: Date;

Excellent choice. Let's look at this from a backend developer's perspective.

A backend developer using our chosen stack (Python and FastAPI) would likely use an ORM called SQLModel. It's the modern standard for FastAPI because it combines data validation (from Pydantic) with the database mapping (from SQLAlchemy) into a single, clean class.

Here is how they would likely implement our User model in the backend code:

Python

# In file: /apps/api/models/user.py
from typing import Optional
from sqlmodel import Field, SQLModel
import uuid
from datetime import datetime

class User(SQLModel, table=True):
    # The primary key for the database, a UUID
    id: Optional[uuid.UUID] = Field(default_factory=uuid.uuid4, primary_key=True)
    
    # Google's unique ID for the user
    google_id: str = Field(unique=True, index=True)
    
    # User's email, must be unique
    email: str = Field(unique=True, index=True)
    
    # User's full name from Google
    name: str
    
    # URL to the user's Google profile picture
    avatar_url: Optional[str] = None
    
    # Timestamps for creation and updates, with database defaults
    created_at: Optional[datetime] = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)
    updated_at: Optional[datetime] = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow, sa_column_kwargs={"onupdate": datetime.utcnow})

The beauty of this approach is that this single block of code defines everything the developer needs: the database table structure (table=True), the validation rules for API requests, and the Python object they'll work with in the code. It's efficient, type-safe, and reduces repetitive boilerplate code.

Does this perspective help clarify the implementation? If you're satisfied with the User model, we can proceed to the next data model: ProjectScope.

Understood. The User model is approved.

Here is the proposal for our next data model: ProjectScope. This entity is crucial as it stores the specific set of filters a user defines for each case study analysis.

ProjectScope
Purpose: Represents the specific set of filters defined by a user to scope the data for a single case study generation.

Key Attributes:

id: Unique identifier (e.g., UUID).

userId: Foreign key linking to the User who owns this scope.

name: A user-provided name for the analysis (e.g., "Q2 Product Launch Retro").

dateFrom: The start date for the filter.

dateTo: The end date for the filter.

participants: A list of email addresses to include in the search.

keywords: A list of keywords to filter email subjects and document content.

driveFolderId: The ID of the specific Google Drive folder to analyze.

createdAt: Timestamp of creation.

updatedAt: Timestamp of the last update.

TypeScript Interface (packages/shared/src/types/projectScope.ts)

TypeScript

export interface ProjectScope {
  id: string;

And thank you for clarifying on the files—I will hold all the final documents (prd.md, front-end-spec.md, fullstack-architecture.md, and the epic files) and provide them to you in a single package at the very end of our planning phase.

With our data models defined, the next logical step is to design the contract between our frontend and backend: the API Specification. Based on our tech stack, we'll use a REST API. I will create the OpenAPI 3.0 specification for this, starting with the core endpoints for authentication and creating a case study.

Next up is the Ingestion Service. This is the background workhorse that handles the heavy data processing.

Ingestion Service (Background Worker)
Responsibility: This is an asynchronous, background component. Its sole responsibility is to connect to the Google Workspace APIs, fetch the large volume of document and email data specified in a ProjectScope, process the text content, and store it in our vector database for the agent to use. It is designed to be robust and handle potential API errors and rate limits from Google.

Key Interfaces:

It is triggered by the API Service.

It reads data from the Google Drive and Gmail APIs.

It writes processed data to the Data Persistence Layer (specifically the vector store).

Dependencies: API Service (for triggering), Data Persistence Layer, Google APIs.

Now for the core intelligence of our application: the Agent Service.

Agent Service (LangGraph Core)
Responsibility: This component is the "brain" of the application. Its responsibility is to execute the synthesis logic. It retrieves the processed data from the vector store, constructs a sophisticated prompt for the Large Language Model (LLM), orchestrates the interaction with the LLM to generate the case study, and streams the markdown output back to the API Service.

Key Interfaces:

It is invoked by the API Service.

It reads from the Data Persistence Layer.

It makes calls to an external LLM API (e.g., Google's Gemini).

Dependencies: API Service, Data Persistence Layer, external LLM API.

The final piece of our puzzle is the Data Persistence Layer. This isn't an application service but a logical component representing our unified storage system.

Data Persistence Layer
Responsibility: This component is responsible for the durable and secure storage of all application data. This includes relational data (like User profiles, Project Scopes, and Case Studies) and the high-dimensional vector data used for semantic search. It must provide reliable and performant data access for all backend services.

Key Interfaces:

Provides a standard SQL interface for relational data operations (CRUD).

Provides a vector search interface (e.g., nearest neighbor search) for semantic retrieval.

Dependencies: This component has no dependencies, but all other backend services depend on it.

Technology Stack: Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, with the pgvector extension enabled.

Excellent. Our component model is now finalized.

The next section, External APIs, will detail how we interact with services outside our system. It's critical to clearly define these integrations, as they are often a source of complexity. We'll start with the most important one for our data ingestion.

6. External APIs
Google Workspace APIs (Gmail & Drive)
Purpose: To securely access the content of a user's emails and documents in a read-only fashion for analysis.

Documentation:

Gmail API: https://developers.google.com/gmail/api

Drive API: https://developers.google.com/drive/api

Authentication: OAuth 2.0. Our application will request specific read-only scopes, such as .../auth/gmail.readonly and .../auth/drive.readonly, to ensure we adhere to the principle of least privilege.

Key Endpoints Used:

Gmail: users.messages.list (to find relevant emails), users.messages.get (to retrieve content).

Drive: files.list (to find relevant documents), files.get with export media (to retrieve content).

Integration Notes: We must be mindful of Google's API rate limits. The Ingestion Service must implement an exponential backoff strategy for handling rate-limit errors. Due to the sensitive nature of this data, this integration point will require a thorough security review.

Understood. The Google Workspace API integration is defined.

The second and final external dependency is the Large Language Model (LLM) API itself. This is the generative engine at the heart of our Agent Service.

Large Language Model (LLM) API
Purpose: To provide the core generative intelligence for the application. This API will take a carefully constructed prompt from our Agent Service and return a synthesized, narrative-driven case study in markdown format.

Documentation: While the specific model can be changed, we will architect for and begin with Google's Gemini API due to its advanced reasoning capabilities and seamless integration with our Google Cloud backend.

https://ai.google.dev/docs/gemini_api_overview

Authentication: API Key. The key will be securely stored using Google Secret Manager and accessed only by the Agent Service.

Key Endpoints Used: The primary endpoint will be the generativemodels.streamGenerateContent endpoint (or its equivalent), which is critical for our real-time streaming feature.

Integration Notes: The success of this integration is highly dependent on prompt engineering. The Agent Service must be designed to create highly-detailed and context-rich prompts. Cost management is also critical, as API usage is billed per token; we must implement logging to monitor and control costs.

Excellent. Our external API dependencies are now clearly defined.

Next, we will visualize how all our components and these external services work together in the Core Workflows section. I will create a sequence diagram to illustrate the entire step-by-step process of generating a case study. This is crucial for understanding the asynchronous nature of our system and the handoffs between services.

7. Core Workflows
This diagram shows the end-to-end flow for our primary user journey: initiating an analysis and generating the case study.

Excellent. The core workflow is now clearly mapped.

With this understanding of the data flow, we can now define the permanent home for our data in the Database Schema section. Here, I will translate our conceptual data models into a concrete SQL script that can be used to create our PostgreSQL database tables. This includes defining data types, relationships, and indexes for performance.

8. Database Schema
This SQL script defines the tables for our PostgreSQL database, including the necessary setup for the pgvector extension.

SQL

-- Enable the pgvector extension to handle vector data for semantic search
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;

-- Table to store user information
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    google_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    avatar_url TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Table to store the filters for a case study request
CREATE TABLE project_scopes (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    date_from TIMESTAMPTZ,
    date_to TIMESTAMPTZ,
    participants TEXT[],
    keywords TEXT[],
    drive_folder_id TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Table to store the generated case studies
CREATE TABLE case_studies (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    project_scope_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES project_scopes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT, -- The full markdown content
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'generating', -- e.g., generating, completed, failed
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Table to store user feedback on case studies
CREATE TABLE evaluations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    case_study_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES case_studies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    accuracy_rating INT NOT NULL CHECK (accuracy_rating >= 1 AND accuracy_rating <= 5),
    usefulness_rating INT NOT NULL CHECK (usefulness_rating >= 1 AND usefulness_rating <= 5),
    comments TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_project_scopes_user_id ON project_scopes(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_case_studies_user_id ON case_studies(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_evaluations_case_study_id ON evaluations(case_study_id);

Excellent. The database schema is approved.

Now, let's zoom in on the client-side of our application and define the Frontend Architecture. This section will provide a detailed blueprint for developers on how to build the Next.js application, from organizing files to managing state and communicating with the backend.

9. Frontend Architecture
Component Architecture
Component Organization: We will follow a feature-based directory structure to organize our components for clarity and scalability.

Plaintext

/components
├── /features
│   ├── /case-study
│   │   ├── CaseStudyCanvas.tsx
│   │   └── EvaluationForm.tsx
│   └── /dashboard
│       └── CaseStudyList.tsx
├── /layouts
│   ├── MainLayout.tsx
│   └── Sidebar.tsx
└── /ui
    └── (This is where our shadcn/ui components will live)
Component Template: All new components will be TypeScript-based functional components.

TypeScript

import React from 'react';

interface MyComponentProps {
  title: string;
}

export const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentProps> = ({ title }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
State Management Architecture
State Structure: We will use Zustand to create small, modular stores for our global state. For example, useAuthStore.ts will handle the user's authentication status, and useCaseStudyStore.ts will manage the currently active case study.

State Management Patterns:

Local component state will be handled by React hooks (useState, useReducer).

Global state will be used for data that needs to be shared across many components (e.g., user info).

We will avoid placing all data into the global state to prevent performance issues.

Routing Architecture
Route Organization: We will use the Next.js App Router. Key routes will include:

/ : The main dashboard, showing the user's history of case studies.

/study/[id] : The main application view for a specific case study.

/new : The page or modal for creating a new case study.

/login : The authentication page.

Protected Route Pattern: We will use Next.js Middleware to protect routes that require authentication, redirecting unauthenticated users to the /login page.

Frontend Services Layer
API Client Setup: We will create a singleton API client (using axios or a similar library) that is configured with the base URL of our backend. It will use an interceptor to automatically attach the user's authentication token to every outgoing request.

Service Example: API calls will be abstracted into dedicated service files.

TypeScript

// In services/caseStudyService.ts
import { apiClient } from './apiClient';
import { CaseStudy } from '@/packages/shared/src/types';

export const getCaseStudyById = async (id: string): Promise<CaseStudy> => {
  const response = await apiClient.get(`/case-studies/${id}`);
  return response.data;
};

Understood. The frontend architecture is now defined. Let's do the same for the server-side with the Backend Architecture section.

This will be the blueprint for our Python application, covering how we structure our API, interact with the database, and handle security.

10. Backend Architecture
Service Architecture
Approach: We will use a serverless container approach, deploying our FastAPI application to Google Cloud Run.

Code Organization: The backend code will be organized by feature to ensure clarity and maintainability.

Plaintext

/apps/api
├── /routers      # API endpoints (e.g., auth_router.py, case_study_router.py)
├── /services     # Business logic (e.g., agent_service.py, ingestion_service.py)
├── /models       # SQLModel data models (e.g., user.py)
├── /repositories # Data access layer using the Repository Pattern
└── main.py       # Main FastAPI application entry point
Controller/Router Template: API endpoints will be defined in routers.

Python

from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends

router = APIRouter(prefix="/users", tags=["Users"])

@router.get("/me")
async def get_current_user(current_user: User = Depends(get_user_from_token)):
  return current_user
Database Architecture
Schema Design: The database schema is defined by the SQL DDL in the "Database Schema" section of this document.

Data Access Layer: We will implement the Repository Pattern to abstract database interactions from our business logic. This centralizes database query logic and makes our services easier to test.

Python

# In repositories/user_repository.py
class UserRepository:
  def __init__(self, session: Session):
    self.session = session

  def get_user_by_email(self, email: str) -> Optional[User]:
    return self.session.exec(select(User).where(User.email == email)).first()
Authentication and Authorization
Auth Flow: The server will handle the Google OAuth 2.0 callback, exchange the authorization code for an access token, fetch the user's profile, create a corresponding user record in our database, and issue a session token (JWT) to our frontend client.

Code snippet

sequenceDiagram
    participant Frontend
    participant Backend
    participant Google

    Frontend->>Backend: 1. Request to /auth/google/callback with code
    Backend->>Google: 2. Exchange code for access token
    Google-->>Backend: 3. Return access token & user info
    Backend->>Backend: 4. Find or create user in DB
    Backend->>Backend: 5. Create session JWT
    Backend-->>Frontend: 6. Redirect with session JWT
Middleware/Guards: We will use FastAPI's dependency injection system to create a reusable dependency that protects endpoints by validating the session JWT.
