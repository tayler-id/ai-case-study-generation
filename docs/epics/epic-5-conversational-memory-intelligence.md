    id: int = Field(primary_key=True)
    case_study_id: int = Field(foreign_key="case_studies.id")
    session_id: str
    user_id: uuid.UUID = Field(foreign_key="user.id")
    message_history: List[Dict] = Field(sa_column=Column(JSON))
    context_references: List[Dict] = Field(sa_column=Column(JSON))
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime

class WorkingMemory(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: int = Field(primary_key=True)
    session_id: str
    temporary_notes: Dict = Field(sa_column=Column(JSON))
    email_cross_references: List[Dict] = Field(sa_column=Column(JSON))

- **Memory Integration**: Session memory + case study return memory
- **RAG System**: Vector search over email content with contextual responses

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Chat interface integrated into existing side panel
- [ ] Natural language processing for user queries
- [ ] Contextual responses with email/document references
- [ ] Support for specific participant queries ("What did Sarah say about...")
- [ ] Support for topic-based queries ("Show me emails about budget")
- [ ] Support for timeline queries ("What happened in March regarding...")
- [ ] Support for decision-maker identification queries
- [ ] Conversation memory maintained throughout session
- [ ] Memory persistence when returning to case studies from dashboard
- [ ] Smart suggestions based on current case study content
- [ ] Response citations with links to source emails

**Supported Query Examples**:
```
User: "What were the main concerns Sarah raised about the API integration?"
Response: "Based on the email thread from March 15-18, Sarah raised three main concerns about the API integration:

1. **Security**: She mentioned concerns about data encryption in her email on March 15: 'We need to ensure all API calls use TLS 1.3 and implement proper token rotation.'

2. **Performance**: On March 17, she noted: 'The current API response times are averaging 800ms, which is too slow for our real-time features.'

3. **Documentation**: She emphasized: 'The API documentation is incomplete - we're missing error codes and rate limiting details.'

[Referenced emails: sarah.johnson@company.com, March 15 11:23 AM, March 17 2:45 PM]"

User: "Show me all emails where budget was discussed"
Response: "I found 8 emails discussing budget between February 10 - March 22:

**Budget Approval Thread** (Feb 10-12)
- Initial budget request: $150K for development phase
- CFO approval with 10% reduction requirement

**Resource Allocation Discussion** (Feb 28 - Mar 5)  
- Discussion about contractor vs internal team costs
- Final decision: hybrid approach saving $20K

**Scope Change Impact** (Mar 18-22)
- Additional feature requests affecting budget
- Approved additional $25K for extended timeline
