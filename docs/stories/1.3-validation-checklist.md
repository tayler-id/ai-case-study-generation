## Story Status: ✅ COMPLETED

**Completion Date**: January 20, 2024
**Implementation**: Stories 1.3 and 1.4 were implemented together as they form a cohesive data integration feature set.

### Key Achievements
- OAuth integration leverages existing Google authentication system
- Real-time connection health monitoring
- Seamless data preview integration
- Robust error handling and user feedback
- Production-ready security and performance

### Technical Decisions
