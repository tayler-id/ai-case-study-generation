# Story 1.4: Real Data Integration

## Overview
Implement actual data fetching from Gmail and Google Drive APIs to collect real project information, with project-scoped filtering and comprehensive data preview capabilities.

## User Story
**As a user with connected data sources**, I want to fetch and preview real emails and documents related to my project so that I can ensure the right data is collected for case study generation.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Backend Requirements
- [x] Implement Gmail API integration for email fetching
- [x] Implement Google Drive API integration for document retrieval
- [x] Create project-scoped data filtering (keywords, participants, date ranges)
- [x] Add data preview endpoints with limited results
- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling for API failures
- [x] Add data parsing and content extraction

### Frontend Requirements
- [x] Enhance project scoping modal with live data preview
- [x] Create data preview components for emails and documents
- [x] Add loading states and progress indicators
- [x] Implement error handling and user feedback
- [x] Show data availability before full generation

### API Endpoints
- `POST /data/fetch/gmail` - Fetch Gmail data for project scope
- `POST /data/fetch/drive` - Fetch Google Drive data for project scope
- `POST /data/fetch/all` - Fetch all available data for project scope
- `POST /data/preview` - Preview available data without full fetch

## Technical Implementation

### Gmail Integration
```python
# Gmail API Service
- Search emails by keywords and participants
- Filter by date ranges
- Extract email content, attachments, and metadata
- Handle pagination and rate limiting
- Parse email threads and conversations
```

### Google Drive Integration
```python
# Drive API Service
- Search documents by keywords and participants
- Filter by modification dates and file types
- Extract document content and metadata
- Handle various file formats (Docs, Sheets, PDFs)
- Manage API quotas and rate limiting
```

### Data Preview System
```typescript
// Frontend Data Preview
- Real-time data availability checking
- Sample content display (first few emails/documents)
- Estimated data volume indicators
- Connection health monitoring
- Preview before full data fetch
```

## Key Components

### 1. **Gmail Service**
   - Email search and filtering
   - Thread analysis and grouping
   - Attachment handling
   - Content extraction and parsing

### 2. **Google Drive Service**
   - Document search and retrieval
   - Content extraction from various formats
   - File metadata and permissions
   - Folder structure analysis

### 3. **Data Preview Components**
   - Live preview in project scoping modal
   - Sample email and document display
   - Data volume and availability indicators
   - Interactive filtering and refinement

### 4. **Error Handling**
   - API rate limiting and quotas
   - Permission and authentication errors
   - Network connectivity issues
   - Data format and parsing errors

## Dependencies
- Story 1.3: Data Source Permission Granting (prerequisite)
- Gmail API v1 client library
- Google Drive API v3 client library
- Content parsing libraries for various file formats

## Definition of Done
- [x] Users can fetch real Gmail and Drive data for their projects
- [x] Data is properly filtered by project scope (keywords, participants, dates)
- [x] Preview functionality shows sample data before full fetch
- [x] All API errors are handled gracefully with user feedback
- [x] Data parsing works for common email and document formats
- [x] Performance is acceptable for typical project data volumes
- [x] Unit tests cover API integration and data parsing
- [x] Integration tests verify end-to-end data fetching flows

## Test Scenarios

### Gmail Integration
1. **Basic Email Fetch**: Retrieve emails matching project criteria
2. **Thread Analysis**: Group related emails into conversations
3. **Attachment Handling**: Extract and process email attachments
4. **Large Volume**: Handle projects with hundreds of emails
5. **Rate Limiting**: Graceful handling of API quota limits

### Google Drive Integration
1. **Document Search**: Find documents matching project keywords
2. **Multiple Formats**: Handle Docs, Sheets, PDFs, and other formats
3. **Content Extraction**: Parse text content from various file types
4. **Folder Permissions**: Handle shared and private folder access
5. **Large Files**: Manage memory and processing for large documents

### Data Preview
1. **Live Preview**: Real-time data availability checking
2. **Sample Display**: Show representative emails and documents
3. **Volume Estimation**: Accurate data volume predictions
4. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of preview failures
5. **Performance**: Fast preview loading for good UX

## Performance Considerations
- **Batch Processing**: Fetch data in manageable chunks
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data and metadata
- **Streaming**: Stream large datasets to avoid memory issues
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect API quotas and implement backoff
- **Content Parsing**: Efficient text extraction from documents

## Security Considerations
- **Data Privacy**: Only fetch data user has explicitly authorized
- **Content Filtering**: Avoid processing sensitive or personal data
- **Access Control**: Ensure users only see their own data
- **Audit Logging**: Log data access for security monitoring

## Notes
- Gmail API has specific rate limits and quotas
- Google Drive API supports various file formats with different parsing requirements
- Consider implementing data caching for frequently accessed projects
- Preview should be fast and lightweight to maintain good UX
- Full data fetch may take significant time for large projects
