# Story 3.8: Add Delete Case Studies Option

**Epic**: Epic 3: User Interaction & Persistence  
**Story**: 3.8  
**Status**: ðŸ”„ PENDING

## Overview
Add functionality for users to delete old or unwanted case studies from their dashboard, providing better case study management and storage cleanup capabilities.

## User Story
**As a user**, I want to delete case studies from my dashboard that I no longer need, so that I can keep my workspace organized and remove outdated or irrelevant analyses.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Delete Functionality
- [ ] Delete button/option available for each case study in the dashboard
- [ ] Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions
- [ ] Successful deletion removes case study from database and UI
- [ ] User receives clear feedback when deletion is successful or fails

### User Interface
- [ ] Delete option integrated into dashboard case study list/cards
- [ ] Clear visual indicator for delete action (icon, button, menu option)
- [ ] Confirmation modal with clear messaging about permanent deletion
- [ ] Loading state during deletion process

### Data Management
- [ ] Case study completely removed from database
- [ ] Associated data (ratings, comments) also deleted
- [ ] Proper cleanup of any file attachments or related data
- [ ] Database integrity maintained after deletion

### Safety & Confirmation
- [ ] Two-step deletion process (click delete, then confirm)
- [ ] Clear warning about permanent deletion in confirmation dialog
- [ ] Option to cancel deletion at confirmation stage
- [ ] No accidental deletions from single-click actions

## Technical Implementation

### Database Operations
```sql
-- Cascade deletion for related data
DELETE FROM case_study_evaluations WHERE case_study_id = ?;
DELETE FROM case_studies WHERE id = ? AND user_id = ?;

-- Ensure proper foreign key constraints
ALTER TABLE case_study_evaluations 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_case_study 
FOREIGN KEY (case_study_id) 
REFERENCES case_studies(id) 
ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

### API Endpoints
```typescript
// Delete case study endpoint
DELETE /api/case-studies/{id}
- Validates user ownership
- Performs cascading deletion
- Returns success/error response
- Logs deletion activity

// Response structure
interface DeleteResponse {
  success: boolean;
  message: string;
  deletedId?: string;
}
```

### Frontend Components
```typescript
// Delete confirmation component
interface DeleteConfirmationProps {
  caseStudyId: string;
  caseStudyTitle: string;
  onConfirm: (id: string) => void;
  onCancel: () => void;
  isLoading: boolean;
}

// Dashboard integration
- Add delete button to case study cards
- Implement confirmation modal
- Handle delete state management
- Update UI after successful deletion
```

## Key Components

### 1. **Delete Interface**
   - Delete button/icon on each case study
   - Confirmation modal component
   - Loading states during deletion
   - Success/error notifications

### 2. **Data Management**
   - Cascading deletion of related records
   - Proper database transaction handling
   - File cleanup for attachments
   - Database integrity validation

### 3. **User Experience**
   - Clear delete confirmation process
   - Immediate UI feedback
   - Undo option considerations
   - Bulk delete capabilities (future enhancement)

### 4. **Security & Validation**
   - User ownership verification
   - Authorization checks
   - Input validation for case study ID
   - Audit logging for deletions

## Dependencies
- Story 3.2: Dashboard and History View (prerequisite)
- Case study database schema and API
- User authentication and authorization system
- Frontend modal/dialog component system

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Users can delete case studies from the dashboard
- [ ] Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions
- [ ] Case studies are completely removed from database
- [ ] Related data (evaluations, comments) properly deleted
- [ ] UI immediately reflects successful deletions
- [ ] Clear error messages for failed deletions
- [ ] User authorization properly enforced (users can only delete their own studies)
- [ ] Database integrity maintained after deletions
- [ ] Unit tests cover deletion functionality
- [ ] Integration tests verify complete data cleanup
- [ ] Manual testing confirms proper delete workflow

## Test Scenarios

### Delete Functionality
1. **Successful Deletion**: Case study successfully deleted from database and UI
2. **Confirmation Process**: Confirmation dialog appears and works correctly
3. **Cancellation**: User can cancel deletion from confirmation dialog
4. **Authorization**: Users can only delete their own case studies
5. **Data Cleanup**: All related data properly removed from database

### User Interface
1. **Delete Button**: Delete option clearly visible and accessible
2. **Visual Feedback**: Clear loading state during deletion
3. **Success Notification**: User receives confirmation of successful deletion
4. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for failed deletions
5. **UI Updates**: Dashboard immediately reflects deletion

### Error Scenarios
1. **Network Failure**: Proper error handling for network issues
2. **Database Error**: Graceful handling of database deletion failures
3. **Unauthorized Access**: Proper rejection of unauthorized delete attempts
4. **Non-existent Study**: Appropriate handling of attempts to delete non-existent studies
5. **Concurrent Deletions**: Proper handling of race conditions

## Security Considerations

### Authorization
- **User Ownership**: Verify user owns case study before deletion
- **Authentication**: Ensure user is properly authenticated
- **Permission Checks**: Validate user has delete permissions
- **Session Validation**: Verify valid user session

### Data Protection
- **Soft Delete Option**: Consider soft delete for data recovery
- **Audit Trail**: Log deletion activities for security monitoring
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure complete removal of sensitive data
- **Backup Considerations**: Coordinate with backup/archive systems

## Performance Considerations
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient cascading deletion queries
- **UI Responsiveness**: Fast UI updates after deletion
- **Bulk Operations**: Consider bulk delete for multiple selections
- **Index Management**: Ensure proper database indexing for delete operations

## User Experience Enhancements

### Basic Implementation
- Single case study deletion with confirmation
- Clear visual feedback and notifications
- Proper error handling and messaging

### Future Enhancements
- Bulk selection and deletion of multiple case studies
- Soft delete with trash/recycle bin functionality
- Export case study before deletion option
- Advanced filtering for easier management

## Accessibility Considerations
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Delete functionality accessible via keyboard
- **Screen Readers**: Clear labels and descriptions for delete actions
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling in confirmation dialogs
- **High Contrast**: Ensure delete buttons visible in high contrast mode

## Configuration Options
- **Confirmation Settings**: Configurable confirmation requirements
- **Soft Delete**: Option to enable soft delete vs permanent deletion
- **Audit Logging**: Configurable logging levels for deletions
- **Bulk Delete**: Configurable limits for bulk deletion operations

## Database Schema Considerations
```sql
-- Option 1: Hard delete (immediate removal)
DELETE FROM case_studies WHERE id = ? AND user_id = ?;

-- Option 2: Soft delete (mark as deleted)
ALTER TABLE case_studies ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL;
UPDATE case_studies SET deleted_at = NOW() WHERE id = ? AND user_id = ?;

-- Option 3: Archive instead of delete
ALTER TABLE case_studies ADD COLUMN archived BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
UPDATE case_studies SET archived = TRUE WHERE id = ? AND user_id = ?;
```

## Notes
- Consider implementing soft delete initially for data recovery options
- Deletion should be irreversible from user perspective but recoverable by admin
- Monitor deletion patterns to understand user behavior
- Consider adding export functionality before deletion
- Ensure proper cleanup of any associated files or external resources
- Plan for potential "undo" functionality in future iterations
