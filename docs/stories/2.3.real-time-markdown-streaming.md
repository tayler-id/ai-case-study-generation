# Story 2.3: Real-Time Markdown Streaming

**Epic**: Epic 2: Case Study Generation & V1 Canvas  
**Story**: 2.3  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED & QA APPROVED  

## Story Description
*As a user, I want to see the markdown document being generated by the agent stream into the canvas in real-time, so that I get transparent feedback on the agent's progress.*

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When the case study generation is initiated, the right-hand canvas displays a "Writing..." status animation
2. As the LLM generates the markdown, the text is streamed token-by-token into the canvas
3. The streamed text is correctly rendered as formatted GitHub Flavored Markdown (e.g., headings, lists, bold text)
4. The streaming process concludes when the agent finishes generating the document

## Technical Requirements
- Implement SSE (Server-Sent Events) or WebSocket connection for real-time streaming
- Ensure markdown rendering updates in real-time as content streams
- Maintain smooth UI performance during streaming
- Handle connection errors and interruptions gracefully
- Integrate with existing Canvas component

## Tasks
- [x] Verify existing streaming infrastructure in backend
- [x] Enhance Canvas component to handle real-time markdown updates
- [x] Implement token-by-token streaming display
- [x] Add "Writing..." status animation to Canvas
- [x] Test streaming performance and error handling
- [x] Ensure GitHub Flavored Markdown rendering works correctly
- [x] Test streaming conclusion and completion states

## Dev Notes
- Build on existing LLM service integration (Story 2.1)
- Enhance the Canvas component from Story 2.2
- Use ReactMarkdown for real-time rendering
- Consider performance optimization for large documents

## Testing
- [x] Verify streaming starts with proper animation
- [x] Test token-by-token streaming display
- [x] Validate markdown formatting during streaming
- [x] Test streaming completion and final state
- [x] Test error handling and recovery

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet

### Tasks Status
- [x] Verify existing streaming infrastructure in backend
- [x] Enhance Canvas component to handle real-time markdown updates
- [x] Implement token-by-token streaming display
- [x] Add "Writing..." status animation to Canvas
- [x] Test streaming performance and error handling
- [x] Ensure GitHub Flavored Markdown rendering works correctly
- [x] Test streaming conclusion and completion states

### Debug Log
- Fixed React infinite loop issue with calculated `isStreaming` prop
- Fixed content persistence by accumulating regardless of section boundaries  
- Fixed frontend-backend data format conversion for saved case studies
- Added comprehensive error handling and resource cleanup
- Optimized UI performance with proper state management

### Completion Notes
Successfully implemented real-time markdown streaming functionality:

1. **Canvas Component Enhancement**: Added `streamingContent` and `isStreaming` props to handle real-time content updates
2. **Token-by-Token Display**: Implemented dynamic content updates with typing cursor animation
3. **Writing Animation**: Added bouncing dots animation while AI analyzes data
4. **MainContent Integration**: Wired up streaming props from parent to Canvas component
5. **Backend Connection**: Verified existing streaming infrastructure using SSE (Server-Sent Events)
6. **GitHub Flavored Markdown**: Real-time rendering with ReactMarkdown and remark-gfm plugins

### File List
**Modified Files:**
- `apps/web/components/Canvas.tsx` - Added streaming props and real-time display logic
- `apps/web/components/MainContent.tsx` - Added streaming prop pass-through to Canvas
- `apps/web/app/page.tsx` - Connected streaming state to MainContent component

**Verified Files:**
- `apps/web/components/ChatPanel.tsx` - Confirmed streaming service integration
- `apps/web/services/caseStudyService.ts` - Confirmed SSE streaming implementation
- `apps/api/routers/case_study_router.py` - Confirmed backend streaming endpoint

### Change Log
1. **Canvas Component**: Added `isStreaming` state logic with typing cursor and bouncing dots animations
2. **MainContent Interface**: Extended props to support streaming content and state
3. **Data Flow**: Connected streaming from ChatPanel → MainContent → Canvas
4. **Animation States**: Implemented three states - waiting (bouncing dots), streaming (typing cursor), and completed (rating display)
5. **TypeScript Fixes**: Resolved property name conflicts in ProjectScope interface usage
