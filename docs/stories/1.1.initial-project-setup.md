# Story 1.1: Initial Project Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a bootstrapped Next.js and FastAPI application within a Monorepo,
**so that** I have a clean, organized starting point for development.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Monorepo is initialized with the appropriate tooling.
2. A Next.js application is created in the `/apps/web` directory.
3. A Python FastAPI application is created in the `/apps/api` directory.
4. Both applications can be started concurrently with a single command from the root.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Initialize Monorepo Structure (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create root directory structure with `apps/`, `packages/` folders
  - [x] Initialize pnpm workspace configuration (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
  - [x] Setup root `package.json` with workspace scripts
  - [x] Create shared TypeScript configuration in `packages/shared/`

- [x] Task 2: Setup Next.js Frontend Application (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create Next.js app in `/apps/web` using TypeScript template
  - [x] Configure Tailwind CSS integration
  - [x] Install and configure shadcn/ui components
  - [x] Setup Framer Motion for animations
  - [x] Configure Zustand for state management
  - [x] Add Next.js 15.x.x to package.json

- [x] Task 3: Setup Python FastAPI Backend (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create FastAPI application structure in `/apps/api`
  - [x] Setup Python 3.12.x virtual environment
  - [x] Install FastAPI 0.111.x and dependencies
  - [x] Create basic FastAPI main.py with health check endpoint
  - [x] Setup SQLModel for database models
  - [x] Configure environment variables and settings

- [x] Task 4: Configure Concurrent Development (AC: 4)
  - [x] Add concurrently package to root dependencies
  - [x] Create npm scripts for starting both apps simultaneously
  - [x] Setup development proxy configuration
  - [x] Configure CORS for local development
  - [x] Test concurrent startup and basic connectivity

## Dev Notes

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: docs/architect.md - Tech Stack Section]

**Frontend Stack:**
- TypeScript 5.5.x for type safety
- Next.js 15.x.x as React framework 
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.x for styling
- shadcn/ui & Radix for UI components
- Zustand 4.x.x for state management
- Framer Motion for animations

**Backend Stack:**
- Python 3.12.x
- FastAPI 0.111.x web framework
- SQLModel for data models and ORM
- REST API architecture

**Development Tools:**
- pnpm workspaces for monorepo management
- Concurrently for running multiple services

### Repository Structure
[Source: docs/architect.md - Repository Structure Section]

```
/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/          # Next.js frontend
│   └── api/          # FastAPI backend
└── packages/
    └── shared/       # Shared TypeScript types and utilities
```

### Platform and Infrastructure
[Source: docs/architect.md - Platform Choice]
- Frontend deployment target: Vercel
- Backend deployment target: Google Cloud Run
- Development: Local with concurrent processes

### Project Assumptions
[Source: docs/prd.md - Technical Assumptions]
- Monorepo approach for simplified dependency management
- Decoupled frontend and backend with API communication
- Full testing pyramid strategy (unit, integration, E2E)
- Repository pattern for backend data access

### Initial Configuration Requirements
- CORS configuration for local development (frontend port 3000, backend port 8000)
- Environment variables setup for both applications
- Basic health check endpoints for service verification
- TypeScript strict mode enabled for type safety

### Testing
Testing requirements will be addressed in subsequent stories, but initial setup should include:
- Basic test structure setup for both frontend and backend
- Test script configurations in package.json files

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

### Debug Log References
- Frontend compilation errors resolved (Tailwind CSS v4 syntax → v3)
- ESLint errors fixed for unused imports and empty interfaces
- Port conflicts resolved (moved API from 8000 to 8001)

### Completion Notes List
- ✅ **Monorepo restructuring completed**: Successfully moved existing Next.js app from root to `/apps/web`
- ✅ **FastAPI backend created**: Complete structure with health endpoints, CORS, and proper organization
- ✅ **pnpm workspaces configured**: Proper dependency management across packages
- ✅ **Shared types package**: TypeScript interfaces from architecture docs implemented
- ✅ **Concurrent development**: Both apps tested and working on localhost:3001 (web) and localhost:8001 (api)
- ✅ **Frontend functionality preserved**: All existing components and features working after restructure
- ✅ **Build process verified**: Both individual and combined builds successful

### File List
**Root Configuration:**
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (created)
- `package.json` (updated with workspace scripts)
- `README.md` (updated with monorepo documentation)
