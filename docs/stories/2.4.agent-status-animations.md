# Story 2.4: Agent Status Animations

**Epic**: Epic 2: Case Study Generation & V1 Canvas  
**Story**: 2.4  
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  

## Story Description
*As a user, I want to see unique and informative animations for different agent status phases, so that I understand what the AI is doing at each stage of the generation process.*

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A unique animation for "Analyzing Data" phase (between user request and writing) that shows the agent is processing project data
2. A unique animation for "Writing..." phase (during markdown streaming) that visually indicates active content generation
3. Non-intrusive display within the UI that doesn't interfere with the main content
4. UI returns to neutral "Ready" state once generation is complete
5. Status text updates match the animation phases (e.g., "Analyzing emails and documents", "Writing case study")

## Technical Requirements
- Enhance existing agent status system in ChatPanel component
- Create distinct animations for each phase of generation
- Ensure animations are performant and don't cause UI lag
- Maintain accessibility standards for motion-sensitive users
- Integrate with existing streaming workflow

## Tasks
- [x] Design unique "Analyzing Data" animation (e.g., pulse effect, data processing visual)
- [x] Design unique "Writing..." animation (different from current bouncing dots)
- [x] Update ChatPanel status display to show new animations
- [x] Add smooth transitions between animation states
- [x] Test animation performance across different devices
- [x] Ensure animations work correctly with existing streaming logic
- [x] Add accessibility considerations (reduced motion support)

## Dev Notes
- Build on existing agent status system in ChatPanel component
- Current status displays at the bottom of ChatPanel with green dot for "Ready"
- Status text already updates during generation phases
- Animations should complement the existing UI design language

## Testing
- [x] Verify "Analyzing Data" animation appears before streaming starts
- [x] Verify "Writing..." animation appears during content streaming
- [x] Test smooth transitions between animation states
- [x] Validate animations don't impact streaming performance
- [x] Test on mobile and desktop viewports
- [x] Verify accessibility with reduced motion preferences

## Design Considerations
- **Analyzing Data**: Could use a subtle pulse or rotating element to suggest data processing
- **Writing**: Could use a typing indicator, flowing text effect, or dynamic pen/cursor animation
- **Transitions**: Should be smooth and not jarring to the user experience
- **Colors**: Should match existing blue theme and provide good contrast

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet

### Tasks Status
- [x] Design unique "Analyzing Data" animation
- [x] Design unique "Writing..." animation  
- [x] Update ChatPanel status display to show new animations
- [x] Add smooth transitions between animation states
- [x] Test animation performance across different devices
- [x] Ensure animations work correctly with existing streaming logic
- [x] Add accessibility considerations (reduced motion support)

### Debug Log
- Fixed TypeScript errors with `any` types in ChatPanel and page.tsx
- Removed unused Loader import from ChatPanel
- All animations compile and work correctly with existing streaming logic

### Completion Notes
Successfully implemented unique status animations for each agent phase:

1. **"Analyzing Data" Animation**: Database icon with rotating animation + pulsing indicator dot
2. **"Writing..." Animation**: PenTool icon with flow animation + bouncing dots sequence  
3. **"Thinking/Insights" Animation**: Brain icon with glowing effect
4. **"Starting" Animation**: Zap icon with pulse effect
5. **"Ready" State**: Green dot indicator (unchanged)

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Smooth transitions between states (300ms duration)
- Accessibility support with `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- Performance optimized animations using CSS transforms
- Context-aware status detection (analyzing, writing, thinking, etc.)
- Enhanced visual feedback with appropriate icons and colors

### File List
**Modified Files:**
- `apps/web/app/globals.css` - Added new animation keyframes and accessibility support
- `apps/web/components/ChatPanel.tsx` - Enhanced getAgentStatusIcon function with new animations
- `apps/web/app/page.tsx` - Enhanced status detection for metadata chunks

**New Animations Added:**
- `@keyframes data-pulse` - Pulsing effect for data processing indicator
- `@keyframes data-analyze` - Rotating animation for database icon
- `@keyframes writing-flow` - Subtle movement for writing animation
- `@keyframes thinking-glow` - Glowing effect for brain icon

### Change Log
1. **Animation System**: Created comprehensive status animation system with 5 distinct states
2. **Icon Integration**: Added lucide-react icons (Database, PenTool, Brain, Zap) for better visual representation
3. **Accessibility**: Implemented `prefers-reduced-motion` support for motion-sensitive users
4. **Performance**: Used CSS transforms instead of layout-affecting properties for smooth animations
5. **TypeScript**: Fixed type errors and improved type safety
6. **Transitions**: Added smooth 200-300ms transitions between animation states
