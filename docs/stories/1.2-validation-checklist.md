# Story 1.2: User Authentication with Google - Validation Checklist

## Story Overview
**As a** user,  
**I want** to sign in to the application using my Google account,  
**so that** my identity is securely verified and the app can request permissions.

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

### AC 1: "Sign in with Google" button is present on landing page
- [ ] Button is visible on the landing page (`/apps/web/app/page.tsx`)
- [ ] Button has proper Google branding and styling
- [ ] Button is accessible (proper aria labels, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Button shows loading state when clicked

### AC 2: Clicking the button initiates the Google OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
- [ ] Button click redirects to Google's OAuth consent screen
- [ ] OAuth flow requests correct scopes: `userinfo.email`, `userinfo.profile`, `openid`, `gmail.readonly`, `drive.readonly`
- [ ] User sees permissions for Gmail and Drive access
- [ ] Flow handles user consent acceptance
- [ ] Flow handles user consent rejection/cancellation

### AC 3: Upon successful authentication, user is redirected to placeholder main application view
- [ ] Successful OAuth callback redirects to main app view
- [ ] User profile information is displayed in the UI
- [ ] Navigation/sidebar shows authenticated state
- [ ] User can access protected routes

### AC 4: User record is created in database, and session is established
- [ ] User record is created/updated in backend database
- [ ] JWT session token is generated and valid
- [ ] Session persists across browser refreshes
- [ ] Session includes user profile data (name, email, avatar)
- [ ] Logout functionality clears session properly

## Technical Implementation Validation

### Backend OAuth Configuration
- [ ] Google Client ID and Secret properly configured in environment
- [ ] OAuth redirect URI matches Google Cloud Console settings (`http://localhost:8001/auth/google/callback`)
- [ ] OAuth scopes correctly configured in backend config
- [ ] Backend endpoints functional: `/auth/google`, `/auth/google/callback`, `/auth/me`

### Frontend OAuth Integration  
- [ ] AuthService handles OAuth flow correctly
- [ ] Zustand auth store manages user state properly
- [ ] Token storage and retrieval working (localStorage)
- [ ] Auth context available throughout application
- [ ] Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users

### Google Cloud Console Configuration
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 Client ID created and configured
- [ ] Authorized JavaScript origins: `http://localhost:3000`  
- [ ] Authorized redirect URIs: `http://localhost:8001/auth/google/callback`
- [ ] OAuth consent screen configured (Testing mode with test users)
- [ ] Required APIs enabled: Gmail API, Drive API, People API

### Database & Models
- [ ] User model defined with required fields (id, google_id, email, name, avatar_url, timestamps)
- [ ] UserRepository implements find-or-create logic
- [ ] Database connection working (SQLite for dev, PostgreSQL for production)
- [ ] User data persists correctly after authentication

### Security & Error Handling
- [ ] JWT tokens have proper expiration
- [ ] Sensitive data (secrets) not exposed in frontend
- [ ] CORS properly configured for local development
- [ ] Error handling for OAuth failures
- [ ] Error handling for network issues
- [ ] Graceful handling of invalid/expired tokens

### User Experience
- [ ] Authentication flow feels smooth and responsive
- [ ] Loading states provide clear feedback
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] UI remains responsive during authentication
- [ ] No flickering or layout shifts during auth state changes

## End-to-End Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Successful Authentication Flow
1. [ ] Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. [ ] Click "Continue with Google" button
3. [ ] Redirected to Google OAuth consent screen
4. [ ] See permissions for Gmail and Drive access
5. [ ] Accept permissions
6. [ ] Redirected back to main application
7. [ ] User profile displayed correctly
8. [ ] Can navigate to protected routes
9. [ ] Refresh browser - session persists

### Scenario 2: Authentication Error Handling
1. [ ] Start OAuth flow
2. [ ] Cancel/reject permissions on Google screen
3. [ ] Redirected back with appropriate error message
4. [ ] Can retry authentication
5. [ ] Test with invalid credentials (if applicable)
6. [ ] Network errors handled gracefully

### Scenario 3: Session Management
1. [ ] Authenticate successfully
2. [ ] Close browser tab/window
3. [ ] Reopen application
4. [ ] User remains authenticated
5. [ ] Logout functionality works
6. [ ] After logout, cannot access protected routes
7. [ ] Can re-authenticate after logout

## Performance & Quality Checks

### Performance
- [ ] OAuth flow completes in reasonable time (< 10 seconds)
- [ ] No memory leaks in auth state management
- [ ] Efficient token validation on protected routes

### Code Quality
- [ ] TypeScript types properly defined for auth-related interfaces
- [ ] Error boundaries handle auth errors gracefully
- [ ] Code follows established patterns and conventions
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns (auth logic, UI, API calls)

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for auth service functions
- [ ] Unit tests for auth store actions
- [ ] Integration tests for auth endpoints
- [ ] Frontend component tests for auth UI
