# UI/UX Specification: AI Case Study Generation Agent

## 1. Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

Our primary persona is the **"Overwhelmed Project Manager."** They are accountable for project outcomes but are trapped in a sea of unstructured data. They feel the pressure to deliver insights but lack the time and tools to find them, often resorting to guesswork and recent memory for critical reports. Our secondary personas (Product Owners, Individual Contributors) share this frustration when trying to get up to speed or understand the history of a project.

#### Usability Goals

* **Confidence & Clarity:** The user should feel confident that the agent is comprehensively reviewing their data. The interface must provide a clear, understandable narrative, replacing ambiguity with certainty.
* **Speed to Insight:** The time it takes to find a critical project insight should be reduced from potential hours of manual searching to mere seconds of agent-assisted discovery.
* **Effortless Workflow:** The process of connecting data and generating a study should feel so simple and fast that it becomes a natural part of every project's lifecycle, not a dreaded chore.

#### Design Principles

1. **Transparent Automation:** The user should always feel in control by seeing what the agent is doing (analyzing, writing, etc.). The process should not be a "black box."
2. **Insight over Information:** The UI's purpose is not just to display data, but to surface meaningful, actionable insights. Every element should serve this goal.
3. **Modern Simplicity:** The interface will be clean, uncluttered, and aesthetically pleasing, using typography, space, and subtle animation to create a calm and focused user experience.

### 2. Information Architecture (IA)

#### Site Map / Screen Inventory

This diagram shows the relationship between the core screens of the application.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Landing Page] --> B{User Authenticated?};
    B -->|No| C[Authentication View];
    B -->|Yes| D[Dashboard / History View];
    C --> D;
    D -->|If Empty State| E[First-Time User Guide];
    D -->|Create New| F[Main Application View];
    F --> G[Project Scoping View];
    G --> F;
    D -->|Selects Past Study| F;
 ```

### Navigation Structure

Primary Navigation: Once logged in, the user will have a simple, persistent sidebar or header with links to "Dashboard" and "Create New Study."

Breadcrumbs: A breadcrumb trail will not be necessary for the MVP, as the information hierarchy is flat.

### 3. User Flows
Flow: Generate a New Case Study
User Goal: To get an automated, insightful case study from a set of project data with minimal effort.

Entry Points: Clicking the "Create New Study" button from the Dashboard.

Success Criteria: A complete, useful, and accurate markdown document is generated and displayed on the canvas, and the user is able to save or edit it.

    Frontend->>User: Displays "Analyzing Data" animation

    Frontend->>User: Displays "Writing..." animation and renders markdown in real-time
    deactivate Frontend
    Backend-->>Frontend: Signals completion
    Frontend->>User: Shows "Evaluation UI" prompt
```

Edge Cases & Error Handling:

Error: Google authentication token has expired. Response: The system should prompt the user to re-authenticate.

Error: No documents are found for the specified filters. Response: The UI should display a clear message like "No data found for these filters. Please broaden your scope and try again."

Error: The agent's analysis or generation process fails. Response: The UI should show a user-friendly error message and suggest trying again or modifying the scope.

### 4. Wireframes & Mockups

Primary Design Files
Visual design mockups and high-fidelity prototypes will be managed in a design tool like Figma. This specification document will serve as the formal brief for those designs.

Key Screen Layout: Main Application View
Purpose: The primary workspace for users to interact with the agent, define project scopes, and see the case studies being generated and edited.

Layout: A three-part layout consisting of a main navigation sidebar, a chat panel, and a content canvas.

### 5. Component Library / Design System

Design System Approach
We will build a custom design system based on the principles of shadcn/ui. This involves using unstyled, accessible primitive components provided by Radix UI and applying our own custom styles using Tailwind CSS.

Core Components
Button: For all primary actions.

Input: For the chat interface and filter fields.

Card: To display items in the Dashboard/History view.

Modal: To house the "Project Scoping" filter interface.

Resizable Panels: The core component for the main split-screen layout.

Avatar: To represent the user and the AI agent in the chat interface.

Progress Indicators: Custom animated components to represent the agent's status.

### 6. Branding & Style Guide

Color Palette
Primary: #2563EB (Blue)

Secondary: #475569 (Slate)

Neutral: Grayscale palette from #F8FAFC to #020617

Typography
Primary Font: "Inter"

Monospace Font: "JetBrains Mono"

Iconography
Icon Library: Lucide Icons.

Spacing & Layout
Grid System: 8px grid system.

### 7. Accessibility Requirements

Compliance Target
Standard: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at the Level AA standard.

Key Requirements
Visual: 4.5:1 color contrast, visible focus indicators, resizable text.

Interaction: Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, adequate touch targets.

Content: Alternative text for images, logical heading structure, labeled forms.

Testing Strategy
Combination of automated tools (axe-core), manual keyboard/screen reader testing, and design reviews.

### 8. Responsiveness Strategy

Breakpoints
Breakpoint Min Width Target Devices
Mobile 0px Mobile phones
Tablet 768px Tablets
Desktop 1024px Laptops, desktops

Export to Sheets
Adaptation Patterns
The desktop two-column layout will collapse to a single-column, tabbed view on mobile.

Navigation will collapse into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.

The mobile experience is optimized for a read-only view of case studies.

### 9. Animation & Micro-interactions

Motion Principles
Purposeful: Animations must provide feedback, guide focus, or communicate status.

Fluid & Performant: Motion will be implemented using Framer Motion.

Respectful: Adherence to prefers-reduced-motion accessibility settings.

Key Animations
Agent Status Animations: Unique animations for "Thinking," "Analyzing Data," and "Writing."

Live Canvas Streaming: Smooth, token-by-token text rendering.

UI Element Transitions: Subtle fade-and-slide transitions for modals and other elements.

### 10. Performance Considerations

Performance Goals
Page Load: Interactive in under 3 seconds.

Interaction Response: UI feedback in under 100ms.

Animation FPS: Consistent 60 frames per second.

Design Strategies
Use of skeleton loaders, lazy loading for non-critical assets, optimistic UI patterns, and list virtualization.

### 11. Next Steps

Immediate Actions
Finalize and save this UI/UX Specification as docs/front-end-spec.md.

Use this specification as the formal brief to create high-fidelity visual designs in a tool like Figma.

Formally hand this document and the PRD off to the Architect to begin creating the fullstack-architecture.md.
